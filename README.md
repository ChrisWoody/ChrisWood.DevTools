# ChrisWood.DevTools
A collection of tools to help make developers lives easier!

## Goals

Other than creating a helpful library for developers, I wanted to use this repo as an opportunity to do and learn more about concepts that I'm not very familiar with.

- TDD
  - Red -> Green -> Refactor!
  - For any new feature I make sure there is a failing test written first.
  - The tests will drive the design of the API.
- NuGet
  - I use NuGet packages all the time, but I'm not very familiar with the process of creating/releasing/updating a NuGet package.
- Documentation
  - As part of adding these APIs I'm conscious that other people will be using them so want to make sure they are easy to use, customise and just make sense.
  - I might add some LINQPad script examples showing how the APIs can be used.

## Contribution

I'm focusing on adding APIs at the moment (all in my spare time), but I am open to PRs or API ideas.
